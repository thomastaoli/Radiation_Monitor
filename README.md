Welcome to Thomas' Radiation Monitor project! This repository hosts a dynamic and automated system designed to track and analyze radiation levels across various Asian cities. Leveraging the power of data scraping, processing, and visualization, this project aims to provide up-to-date and accessible radiation data for both public awareness and research purposes.

**Features**
Automated Data Scraping: Daily updates on radiation levels from multiple cities including Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, Taipei, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Ningbo, Chengdu, and Urumqi.
Data Processing: Efficient handling and transformation of raw data into a user-friendly format.
Visualization Tools: Interactive graphs and maps to track radiation trends and compare data across different locations.
Open Source Collaboration: This project is open for contributions and enhancements.

**How It Works**
Our system automatically scrapes the latest radiation data from various monitoring stations and updates the dataset on a daily basis. The processed data is then stored in CSV format, providing a historical record of radiation levels that can be easily accessed and analyzed.
